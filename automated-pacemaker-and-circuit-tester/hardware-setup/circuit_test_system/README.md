## Automated Circuit Test System – Hardware Architecture

This diagram illustrates the hardware setup used for automated testing and validation of pacemaker circuits.

The system supports programmable power sourcing, battery operation, relay-based power switching, low-current measurement, and instrument-controlled signal injection and measurement. Test execution and logging are orchestrated through a Python-based test framework.

This setup is designed for functional verification, current characterization, and repeatable circuit-level testing.
