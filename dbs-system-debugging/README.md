# Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) – System Debugging & Validation

## Overview
System-level debugging and validation work on a Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) platform, involving both the Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) and External Interface Unit (EIU).

## System Context
The DBS system consists of an implantable stimulation device (IPG) and an external interface unit used for communication, configuration, and validation. The work focused on supporting R&D activities related to hardware bring-up, debugging, and bench-level verification.

## My Role & Contributions
- Performed OrCAD-to-Altium PCB migration for DBS IPG and EIU boards
- Designed and developed custom debug/test boards to support system bring-up and validation
- Supported hardware bring-up through hands-on debugging, including soldering/desoldering, probing, and electrical verification
- Assisted firmware flashing and system initialization during bench testing
- Acquired and analyzed electrical signals on-board using laboratory instrumentation to verify expected system behavior

## Technical Highlights
- PCB design and migration (OrCAD → Altium)
- Custom debug and validation hardware
- Hardware bring-up and electrical debugging
- Hardware–firmware interaction during system initialization
- Bench-level signal acquisition and analysis

## Validation & Testing
System validation was performed through iterative bench testing, waveform observation, and electrical signal verification using oscilloscopes and related test equipment.

## Status
Ongoing R&D support and debugging activities.
