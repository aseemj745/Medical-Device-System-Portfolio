## DBS IPG – PCB Layout Renders

This folder contains PCB layout renders created during debugging and
validation of the DBS Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG).

### What is shown here
- IPG Rev 1.0 – 4 Layer PCB
- IPG Rev 2.1 – 2 Layer PCB

These boards were used for R&D debugging, validation, and system bring-up.

### Design Iterations
- The first revision was used for initial bring-up and testing
- Issues observed during debugging were corrected in the second revision
- Schematic import from OrCAD to Altium was reviewed and cleaned up
- Component packages were updated to improve soldering and rework
  (BGA parts replaced with QFN / TSSOP / VQFN where possible)

### Engineering Work Done
- OrCAD to Altium PCB migration
- Layout modification based on bench-level debugging feedback
- Component footprint updates for easier assembly and probing
- Support for firmware flashing and electrical validation

### Notes
- Only PCB layout renders are shared
- Schematics, BOM, and firmware are not included
- Designs are representative of R&D and debugging work
