# Sample Test Logs (Anonymized)

This folder contains **representative and anonymized sample test logs** generated by the automated pacemaker and circuit test system.

The files are provided to demonstrate:
- Test coverage and sequencing
- Automated result logging
- Pass/Fail evaluation logic
- Operator visibility of measured parameters

These logs do **not** represent real production data.

## What These Logs Show

- Expected vs observed electrical parameters
- Multi-unit testing in a single run
- Automated pass/fail decision at test and unit level
- Highlighting of failed parameters
- Support for re-test and overwrite of failed measurements

The structure reflects how results are generated during automated testing in both **single- and dual-chamber pacemaker** validation as well as **pacing circuit testing**.

## Data Anonymization

To ensure confidentiality:

- Device model names, serial numbers, batch numbers, and dates have been removed
- Tolerances have been omitted or generalized
- Values shown are representative and rounded
- No acceptance limits or internal specifications are disclosed

All data is intended **only to demonstrate system behavior**, not device performance.

---

## How Logs Are Generated

- Test execution is controlled via Python-based automation
- Electrical measurements are acquired from test instruments
- Results are evaluated against predefined criteria
- Data is written to structured Excel templates
- Failed parameters are highlighted automatically
- Final PASS/FAIL status is generated per unit
- Over 500+ circuits and 1500+ pacemaker were tested in regression before using it for Final Production QC

## Notes

These files are included for **demonstration and portfolio purposes only** and should not be interpreted as validation records for any commercial medical device.
