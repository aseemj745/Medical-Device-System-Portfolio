# Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) – System Debugging & Validation

## Overview
System-level debugging and validation work on a Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) platform, involving both the Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) and External Interface Unit (EIU), supporting ongoing R&D activities.

## System Context
The DBS system comprises an implantable stimulation device (IPG) and an external interface unit (EIU) used for communication, configuration, and validation. The work focused on hardware bring-up, debug infrastructure development, and bench-level system verification during iterative design cycles.

## My Role & Contributions
- Migrated multi-layer DBS IPG and EIU PCB designs from OrCAD to Altium Designer
- Designed custom debug and test boards to enable probing, signal access, and controlled system bring-up
- Performed hands-on hardware debugging including soldering, rework, probing, and electrical verification
- Supported firmware flashing and system initialization during bench testing
- Acquired and analyzed on-board electrical signals using laboratory instruments to validate expected behavior

## Engineering Scope & Challenges
- Supporting legacy and evolving hardware designs in an active R&D environment
- Debugging dense, multi-layer PCBs with limited test access
- Coordinating hardware bring-up activities with partially validated firmware
- Creating reusable debug infrastructure to accelerate iterative testing and fault isolation

## Validation & Testing
Validation activities were performed through iterative bench testing, waveform observation, and electrical signal verification using oscilloscopes, power supplies, and related laboratory equipment.

## Status
Ongoing R&D support and system-level debugging activities.
