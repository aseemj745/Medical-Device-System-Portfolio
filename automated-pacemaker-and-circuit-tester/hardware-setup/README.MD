# Hardware & Operator Interface Overview

This section shows the physical testbench and operator-facing console used in the automated pacemaker and circuit test systems. It also includes the corresponding hardware architecture and interfacing that connect custom test hardware, laboratory instruments, and the host PC.

The setup represents a typical production and R&D validation bench, integrating custom-designed test hardware with standard laboratory instruments and software-driven control.
