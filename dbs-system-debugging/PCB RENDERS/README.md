## PCB Design Iterations – DBS IPG (Representative)

This folder contains representative PCB layout renders developed during
system debugging, validation, and iteration of the DBS Implantable Pulse
Generator (IPG).

### Design Iterations & Rationale

- **IPG Rev 1.0 – 4 Layer**
  - Initial layout used for system bring-up and early validation
  - Helped identify layout-level and schematic import issues during bench testing

- **IPG Rev 2.1 – 2 Layer**
  - Iterative revision incorporating corrections from Rev 1.0 learnings
  - Updated component selection and footprints to improve manufacturability
    and debuggability
  - Replaced BGA packages with QFN, TSSOP, and VQFN components to enable
    easier soldering, probing, and rework during R&D validation
  - Improved schematic-to-layout consistency during OrCAD → Altium migration

### Engineering Focus
- Design iteration driven by hands-on debugging and validation feedback
- Emphasis on manufacturability, solderability, and bench-level accessibility
- Support for efficient system bring-up and hardware–firmware integration

### Notes
- Images are PCB layout renders only (top and bottom views)
- Schematics, BOM, and firmware are intentionally excluded
- Designs shown are representative of engineering work and iteration process
