## Automated Pacemaker Test System – Hardware Architecture

This diagram shows the block-level hardware and control architecture used for automated testing of single- and dual-chamber pacemakers.

The system integrates instrument automation, relay-based signal routing, onboard load application, device programming, and controlled mechanical activity for R-mode testing. All test sequencing and data logging are handled by a Python-based framework running on a host PC.

The focus of this setup is reliable, repeatable system-level testing under controlled conditions.
